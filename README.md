# search-GDrive
A single page app to search google drive files and folders



Installation guidelines:

1. Download the code
2. Extract the zip file
3. Go to ```src/fetchData.js``` 
4. Fill up your own ```api_Key``` and ```access_Token``` in the object named ```credentials``` and save it
5. Open the project in the ```Git terminal or Command prompt```
5. Type ```npm install```
7. Type ```npm start```



Since the assignment doesn't require us to develop auth connection, I used the access_Token provided by the link you mentioned in the assignment.

Extra Functionality: Can open the selected file, after filtering, in a separate tab
